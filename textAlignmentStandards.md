# Text Alignment Goals

My goal is to compare the content, not the forms of the translation. Through my alignments, I attempt to show what each translator does with the original words and ideas expressed in the starting text. I am not concerned with the grammatical structures matching up exactly, as that is simply not how languages work. ‘hoc ab illo dicitur’ should align perfectly with ‘he says this.’ The translator has without a doubt understood the original text, and made a conscious choice to choose the active voice here. When the ideas expressed between the original and translation do not perfectly line up, but there is some overlap, I have worked to show that overlap as much as possible [example]. The purpose of this methodology is to allow my users to “get the gist” of the original language by leaning on the translations. Seeking to do a hyper-literal translation would narrow the usability of my alignments to those who are already at a high level in these languages, thereby changing the focus of the project.

## Text Alignment Standards

- definite and indefinite articles are aligned whenever they appear
- demonstrative articles are only aligned when they appear, or when the noun they modify is being emphasis by some particle
- adjectives are aligned separately from the nouns which they modify 
- adverbs are aligned directly, unless they can be aligned to a verb that has the adverb's added meaning
- prepositions are aligned to a bare noun in an inflected language when they are common place additions 
	- (of for genitive, to for dative, etc)
- prepositional phrases are aligned as a unit, since the proposition changes the meaning of the following noun, regardless of the case
- bare vocatives are aligned with their accompanying interjections when they are not present
- interjections are aligned directly when they are present
- subjunctive or optative verbs may simply be aligned to an adversative coordinator
- conjunctions are aligned directly whenever possible
- enclitic conjunctions are taken with the word they are attached to 
- subject pronouns are aligned with their corresponding verbs in languages where they do not need to be expressed
- a verb of being and its predicate adjective can be aligned to verbs if the meaning is the same 
	- (est communis - do share - se comunica)
- compound verbs are aligned with all of the parts of the corresponding English phrasal verbs 
	- (respicio - I look back at)
- For verbs that require a preposition, the preposition is included as a unit with the verb 
	- (opperior - I wait for - espero)
	- (coepio - I begin - Comienzo a)
- the 'personal a' in Spanish is aligned with the noun that requires it
- the sense is meant to be aligned, not the words precisely
	- (Aiaci - to Ajax - yo[with Ajax being the speaker])
- plurals are aligned with singulars, and viceversa, when this does not change the sense
