# ovidTreebank

a very rudimentary site to host work done analyzing treebank `.xml` data

## Current Contents

- `tree.py` : prints out all of the relations for one tree with percentages based on word count
- `compareTrees.py` : prints out a data comparing two authors
  - here I've compared Ovid and Vergil for what is currently treebanked by both
- `ovidVergil.csv`
  - the output from the pervious script 
-  `ovid.csv`
   - the same comparison as above for Ovid 13 and Ovid 1


## Data Files

- ovidAll.xml
  - Ov. Met 1, 13
- vergil.xml
  - Ver. An. AP Syllabus, soon to be all of book 1
