# ovidTreebank

a very rudimentary site to host work done analyzing treebank `.xml` data

## Current Contents

- `tree.py` : prints out all of the relations for one tree with percentages based on word count
- `compareTrees.py` : prints out a data comparing two authors
  - here I've compared Ovid and Vergil for what is currently treebanked by both
- `ovidVergil.csv`
  - the output from the pervious script
